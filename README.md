## Installation

Simply download the `index.html` and `style.css` files and put them in the same directory. You can then open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the animation.

## Usage

The HTML code is straightforward and can be easily modified to fit into any web page. You can change the title of the page by editing the `<title>` tag.

The CSS code uses Google Fonts to import the `Montserrat` font. If you wish to use a different font, simply modify the `font-family` attribute in the `button` selector.
